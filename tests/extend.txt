Note:
* <id x> will match the same input that was matched by the prior x sibling match.
* anonymous match, no node in the parse tree.

use:
    s = x '-' <id x>
    x = 'x'+

match: x-x
match: xxx-xxx
not: xxx-xx
not: xx-xxx

use:
    s = x '-' <id x> 'x'+
    x = 'x'+

match: xxx-xxxxx

Note:
* <eq x> will match x and check it matches the same length as the prior x sibling match.
* anonymous match, the match result node is deleted from the parse tree.

use:
    s = x '-' <eq x>
    x = [xy]+

match: x-x
match: y-x
match: xyx-yxx
not: xxx-xx
not: xxx-xxxx

use:
    s = x '-' <gt x>
    x = [xy]+

match: x-xy
match: yxx-xyyx
match: x-yyyy
not: xxx-xxx


Note:
* <and x y> matches x and then matches y on the matched text.
* the y match can not over-run the text matched by x.
* the y result replaces the x result.

use:
  P = 'x' <and Q R> 'z'
  Q = ~'z'*   
  R = [xyz]*                      

match: xxxyyxz


Palindrome: a tough test case!

use:
  P = x <and M P> <id x> / x?   
  M = (x &x)*              
  x = [a-z]              

match: x
match: xx
match: xxx
match: xxxx
match: xxxxx
match: xxxxxx
match: xxxxxxx
match: xyx
match: xxyyyxx
not: xy
match: madam
match: racecar
